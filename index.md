<h1>Danielle Adams</h1>
<h2> Background </h2>

<p>I was born and raised in Monatana. I grew up doing all the typical small town activities of hunting, riding, and fishing. My home town is made up of about 500 wonderful people who know how to work hard and play hard. Every year I go back for my home town's rodeo.
</P>
<p> I enjoyed school and did well. My favorite subject was art. My father taught the art program at the school and so I had access to all the supplies I ever wanted. </p>

<h2>Where I am Now</h2>

<p>Though I never enjoy sports growing up, I stay pretty consistent going to the gym. It has become my happy place and my friends tend to argue that it is my personality. 
I have slowly started becoming a fan of anime and have created my own anime inspired gym outfits. 
    <br>I still like to produce art when I have time.
    <br> I am obsessed with my dog and have been teaching him tricks such as to close doors, shed hunt, and whisper. 
    <br> Most of my time, however, is split between school, work, and homework.</p>

<h2 id="Jax">My Dog Jax</h2>
<p> Jax is an oversized German Shepherd and Belgian Malinois Mix. He is high energy, but will do anything for attention or treats. He is a ball of fur, energy, and anxiety..  </p>

<p>  Jax loves his "bling" (i.e. bandanas, collars, etc.) and gets very insecure if we take them off. So here he is dressed up as Captain Jax Sparrow.

<h2 id="Art">Art Projects</h2>
<p> Like I said, growing up I had a passion for art and had an amazing mentor; my dad. Unfortunately, I have less time for it, but I still get to enjoy an art project every now and then.
